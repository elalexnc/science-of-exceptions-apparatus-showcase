# What It Does (Public-Safe Summary)

This project is a research-engineering framework for reconstructing and modernizing a historical transcranial ultrasound control concept.

## Core idea
- Preserve historical architecture context (`og_reconstruction`).
- Add a safer, maintainable modernization path (`enhanced_2026`).
- Document sourcing and regulatory orientation at a high level (`research`).

## Value of this work
- Makes legacy technical ideas auditable.
- Separates archival reconstruction from modern safety-first design.
- Supports presentation, review, and planning without exposing private implementation details.

## Non-clinical boundary
- This showcase is not medical advice.
- This showcase is not a treatment protocol.
- This showcase is not for human use.
