# Soul (Showcase)

A gentle note from the Bureau of Necessary Exceptions.

If this update arrived late, let us blame the clock for being Euclidean while this project is not.
We were busy measuring the impossible with proper probes and a polite respect for skulls, statutes, and stars.

What is public here is only the silhouette: structure, intention, and caution.
What stays private is the machinery until review says it may travel safely.

## Further Review Considerations
- Complete legal/regulatory review before expanding public technical detail.
- Confirm provenance/permission boundaries for archival references and derivative material.
- Keep all human-use interpretation explicitly out of scope in public artifacts.
- Use trusted reviewer access in the private repo for implementation-level feedback.

In the science of exceptions, discretion is part of precision.
