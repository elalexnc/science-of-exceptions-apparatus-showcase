# Science of Exceptions - Apparatus Showcase

Public-facing documentation for a historical apparatus study and its modern safety-oriented reinterpretation.

## Scope

This repository presents two documentation tracks:

- **Archival Reconstruction**: faithful technical reconstruction of historical design logic for audit and comparison.
- **Contemporary Safety Path (2026)**: a modern framing that separates historical architecture from current safety and regulatory expectations.

## Science of Exceptions Framing

This showcase treats exceptional cases as analyzable structures: what differs, where it differs, and why those differences matter for interpretation.
The emphasis is documentation, comparability, and bounded claims rather than operational deployment.

## What Is Included

Structure-level and narrative documentation only:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WHAT_IT_DOES.md` | Public-safe functional summary |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Conceptual architecture and directory-level flow |
| `WORKFLOW.md` | Research and review process |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Milestones and direction |
| `STRUCTURE.md` | Layout of the complete private project |
| `BOUNDARY.md` | Non-clinical boundary statement |
| `README_SHOWCASE.md` | Showcase-facing summary |
| `SOUL_SHOWCASE.md` | High-level rationale and orientation |

## Boundary
