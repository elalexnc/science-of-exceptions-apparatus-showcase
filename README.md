# Science of Exceptions — Apparatus Research Framework

A research-engineering framework for reconstructing and modernizing a historical transcranial ultrasound control concept, with emphasis on safety-first design and regulatory awareness.

## What This Project Does

This project maintains two parallel tracks:

- **Archival Reconstruction** — Protocol-faithful reconstruction of historical technical architecture, preserving original design context for auditability
- - **Enhanced 2026 Path** — A modernized, safety-forward redesign that separates legacy approaches from contemporary standards
 
  - The goal is to make legacy neurostimulation concepts auditable and reviewable while documenting sourcing, regulatory orientation, and comparative analysis at a high level.
 
  - ## What's in This Showcase
 
  - This public repository contains structure and documentation only — no source code, datasets, or operational details.
 
  - | Document | Contents |
  - |----------|----------|
  - | `WHAT_IT_DOES.md` | Public-safe functional summary |
  - | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Directory-level design and conceptual flow |
  - | `WORKFLOW.md` | Development and review process |
  - | `ROADMAP.md` | Project milestones and direction |
  - | `STRUCTURE.md` | Folder layout of the full project |
  - | `BOUNDARY.md` | Non-clinical use boundary statement |
 
  - ## Boundary
 
  - This showcase is **not medical advice**, **not a treatment protocol**, and **not for human use**. Full implementation remains in a private repository pending regulatory and expert review.
 
  - ## Tech & Methods
 
  - `Python` · Historical apparatus analysis · Regulatory documentation · Safety-first engineering design
 
  - ## Context
 
  - Part of a broader research program connecting psychophysiological measurement, non-invasive neurostimulation history, and Endocentric Psychology. See [profile overview](https://github.com/elalexnc) for related work.
